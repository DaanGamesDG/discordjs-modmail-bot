<h1 align="center">🎫 Discord modmail bot</h1>

Hello 👋, this is another opensource repo? Well, you can use the code so yes I think.
Anways, make sure to follow the license, open an issue for problems and a PR request if you want to contribute to this project :D. Anways, if you want to use this bot, make sure to check the ["How to set it up"](https://github.com/daangamesdg/) part of this readme.

The only things I want you to do is follow the license, credits aren't really needed however I appriciate it if you do. Claiming that it's your own code is not allowed, not having to give me credits is enough I think.

This is like a v2 of the old modmail bot, this one uses a db rather than the cache to save the ticket information.

**Commands / Features**

To save you some time, I listed every feature / command here:

- Ticket creation (obviously)
- Ticket chat (obviously)
- Spam filter (to make sure no one gets spam DMed by the bot)
- Blacklist / whitelist command
- Whitelisted roles (the roles that have access to the tickets)
- Config command (prefix, whitelisted roles, ticket toggle)
- Ticket creation using a command / mention
- Admin permission overwrite (every admin is able to bypass the ticket blocks - ex: admins & ticket claimers are able to close the ticket)

---

**Permissions**

Permissions, why?! Well, without permissions, the bot might not be able to run properly. Let me explain:

- Read and Send Messages - Without them the bot is not able to respond or see your messages. (required permissions)
- View Channel, Add reactions, Manage Channels, Embed Links (without these the bot might not be able to create tickets)
- Manage Messages - Used to cleanup the config prompts (optional permission)

The best things to do is to give the bot admin permissions but this is completely up to you.
