## Setup

** permissions**
The best option is go give the bot `Administrator` permissions, but you can do it the hard way and only give the permissions it needs. Required permissions:
- Read & Send Messages ~ (obivously) If the bot isn't able to read messages or send messages, it doesn't respond to your requests.
- Manage Channels ~ (required) This is needed so the bot is able to create / edit / delete channels.
- Embed Links & Message Attachments ~ (required) Without the bot isn't able to send 9/10 messages.
- Add Reactiona ~ (required) This is needed to show that the ticket owner has received the reply and to be able to setup the ticket claim system.
